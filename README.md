This is a timed quiz game with multiple-choice questions using dynamic HTML to add or remove elements from the page. It has a high score tab where when you finish the game you can save your name and high score to the scoreboard in local storage. Answering a wrong question will prompt you with a wrong answer selected text, deduct 10 seconds from the timer, and lower your overall score.
on the other hand, if you select a correct answer you will be rewarded points which will show up on the game end screen.
